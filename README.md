# My Personal Blog

I just started blogging on [amaikinono.github.io](https://amaikinono.github.io), and there are a lot to learn!

Thank you for reading!

## Theme

Current theme is based on [jekyll-minimal-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme). It's a simple theme, and perfect for me, a noob on html/css/web stuffs, to learn from and hack on.

## Instructions

Here are some instructions for myself, since I'm not familiar with ruby's development environment.

- Install `ruby` and `rubygems` using pacman.

- Add `$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')/bin` to `PATH`.

- Set mirror site. Follow the instructions on `http://gems.ruby-china.com/`.

- `$ gem install bundler`.

- At the root of this repo, run `$ bundle install`.

- Run `$ bundle exec jekyll serve` to build the site.

- Run `$ bundle update` to update the gems.
